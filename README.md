Q1. Thermal Modelling (Python + Validation):
A Flask-based REST API is implemented where the /calculate endpoint returns the Total Thermal Resistance (°C/W) and Junction Temperature (°C).

Q2. PINN Approach:
A PINN (Physics-Informed Neural Network) is a NN, learning a solution with respect to previously known Physics Laws n Equations [e.g. heat transfer eqns], it could be used to approximate the temperature distribution by embedding the governing heat transfer equations into the loss function. The neural network would be trained to minimize both the prediction error and the residual of the physical equations, ensuring physically consistent outputs.
As a new learner as well as a fresher, would proceed with simpler steady state thermal model, with frameworks like: PyTorch & TensorFlow, and PINN libraries like DeepXDE: and then extending it to more complex and improved version with better accuracy.

Q3. Vertex AI Exposure & Understanding:
I certainly do not have any prior hands-on experience with the Google Vertex AI, but I do have a knowledge and brief understanding of how it is used for building and deploying Generative AI and machine learning solutions.
Vertex Ai is basically a unified platform which provides a space for model development, training, deployment, and managing machine learning models, also simplifying end to end ML workflow.
In context of building engineering or product-focused GenAI tools, Vertex AI could be used in various ways:
1. Build and deploy chatbots, summarization tools.
2. Fine-tune or customize models
3. Monitoring specific model performance, and improving production

I would like to use these Vertex's pre-trained models and APIs to build some GenAI features.

Q4. Motivation & Passion:
I would like to work with the Expert Thermal team because this role closely matches my interest in building real-world engineering products, while contributing across backend development, basic frontend work, and AI/ML integration.

As a fresher, I am eager to learn how experienced engineers approach complex physical problems, validate models, and convert them into scalable and usable software platforms. I am particularly interested in understanding how strong engineering fundamentals are combined with software development to build reliable products.

I see this role as a valuable opportunity to build myself professionally, gain hands-on experience and knowledge on real-life projects, and grow my skills in Python, engineering modelling, and applied AI, while contributing to real-world solutions! I believe I would be a good fit for this role because of my willingness to take ownership, learn quickly, and contribute consistently. I am motivated to put in all efforts to deliver quality work and grow with the team.

Q5. Web Development Ownership (Node.js / React.js):
I have hands-on experience working across backend and frontend development through multiple real-world projects.
On the backend side, I have built and deployed applications using Python and Flask, including a full-stack Web Security Scanner [https://hackersgonnahack.pythonanywhere.com/] that performs automated vulnerability detection (SQL injection, XSS, open redirects) and exposes results via APIs and dashboards.

On the frontend side, I have developed and deployed several HTML, CSS, and JavaScript–based applications, including a personal portfolio website, an e-commerce demo, and multiple interactive projects such as Sudoku, Tic-Tac-Toe with AI logic, and browser-based games

•	E-commerce : https://tanirawat.github.io/E-commerce/
•	Sudoku : https://tanirawat.github.io/Suduko/
•	Tic-Tac-Toe AI : https://tanirawat.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-/

While I have not yet built a production application using Node.js and React.js, I am comfortable with JavaScript, component-based UI thinking, API integration, and full-stack workflows. In such dynamic environment, I would like to take ownership by quickly understanding the existing codebase, breaking tasks into manageable steps, and delivering incremental improvements while ensuring correctness and stability.
